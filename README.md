# Tactical-Tic-Tac-Toe
## About
- This repository contains a very early-highschool attempt to create an online connected Tactical Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML and JavaScript.
- Due to time conflicts with school and new projects being developed, this project has not been continued.
- The contents of the project were posted on GitHub with slight refactoring to the code.
## Plans
- Review and reformat the code.
- Fix bugs and get the game to a more usable state.
- Potentially rewrite from scratch in the future.
## Status
- Old project
